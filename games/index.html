        <h3>Grand Theft Auto V</h3>
        <p>
          Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar
          North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the first main entry in the
          Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. Set within the
          fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the
          single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit
          heists while under pressure from a government agency. The open world design
          lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional
          city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.
